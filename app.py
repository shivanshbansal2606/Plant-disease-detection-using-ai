        The **Plant Disease Recognition System** is a deep learning-based solution developed to assist farmers, researchers, and agriculturalists in detecting plant diseases early using just leaf images. By uploading a photo of a plant leaf, the system identifies whether it's healthy or affected by a specific disease, enabling timely action to prevent crop loss.
